This is a course project from CSC420. My teammate Jiushan Yang and I worked on Nuclei detection and classification using different methods. I did the all the classification part and he did the detection part.


The work is based on this paper:
*Sirinukunwattana, Korsuk, et al. ”Locality sensitive deep learning for detection and classification of nuclei in routine colon cancer histology images.” IEEE transactions on medical imaging 35.5 (2016): 1196-1206 [link](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrkbb/tmi2016_ks.pdf)*
