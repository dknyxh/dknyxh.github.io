I am a fifth year undergraduate student at University of Toronto. My major is computer sciene and I am most interested in computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. I like how we extract information from just images and I love the way we model the various properties of a single image. I believe the computer can see the world in an unconventional way which in turn give us a better understanding of the world.
