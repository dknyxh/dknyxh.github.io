In year 2016, I did this research project under supervision of Prof. Yashar Ganjali. The related paper can be found here: [[1]](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sosr/2016/papers/sosr_paper17.pdf).

During the research, I did a router and a loadbalancer on this distributed SDN controller with my teammate Jay. We developed a multi-level routing hierarchy to facilitate solving the problem that routing and loadbalancing is a centralized problem but the Beehive controller is a distributed controller.
