This research is an open ended project under supervision of Prof. Kyros Kutulakos. I took this research opportunity while I was a full-time employee in Modiface. This a research based on a computational photography research prototype developed by CMU and UofT. You can find related information [Episcan3D](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/episcan3d/html/index.html).

I did maintainance on this prototype and I also developed a automatic calibration tool for syncing the projector and the rolling shutter camera.
